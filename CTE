Here is a SQL query with a common table expression:

WITH cte_top_cities AS (
    SELECT ct.city, COUNT(c.customer_id) AS customer_count
    FROM customer AS c
    JOIN address AS a ON c.address_id = a.address_id
    JOIN city AS ct ON a.city_id = ct.city_id
    JOIN country AS co ON ct.country_id = co.country_id
    GROUP BY ct.city
    ORDER BY customer_count DESC
    LIMIT 10
),
cte_customer_total_paid AS (
    SELECT
        c.customer_id AS "Customer ID",
        c.first_name AS "Customer First Name",
        c.last_name AS "Customer Last Name",
        co.country AS "Country",
        ct.city AS "City",
        SUM(p.amount) AS "Total Amount Paid"
    FROM
        customer AS c
    JOIN
        address AS a ON c.address_id = a.address_id
    JOIN
        city AS ct ON a.city_id = ct.city_id
    JOIN
        country AS co ON ct.country_id = co.country_id
    JOIN
        payment AS p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
    WHERE
        ct.city IN (SELECT city FROM cte_top_cities)
    GROUP BY
        c.customer_id,
        c.first_name,
        c.last_name,
        co.country,
        ct.city
)
SELECT AVG("Total Amount Paid") AS "Average Amount Paid"
FROM cte_customer_total_paid;
