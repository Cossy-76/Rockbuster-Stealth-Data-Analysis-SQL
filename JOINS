Here is a SQL query using "joins" to find the top 5 customers in any of the top 10 cities who've paid the highest total amounts to Rockbuster.

SELECT
    c.customer_id AS "Customer ID",
    c.first_name AS "Customer First Name",
    c.last_name AS "Customer Last Name",
    co.country AS "Country",
    ct.city AS "City",
    SUM(p.amount) AS "Total Amount Paid"
FROM
    customer AS c
JOIN
    address AS a ON c.address_id = a.address_id
JOIN
    city AS ct ON a.city_id = ct.city_id
JOIN
    country AS co ON ct.country_id = co.country_id
JOIN
    payment AS p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
WHERE
    ct.city IN (
        SELECT ct_top.city
        FROM (
            SELECT ct.city, COUNT(c.customer_id) AS customer_count
            FROM customer AS c
            JOIN address AS a ON c.address_id = a.address_id
            JOIN city AS ct ON a.city_id = ct.city_id
            JOIN country AS co ON ct.country_id = co.country_id
            GROUP BY ct.city
            ORDER BY customer_count DESC
            LIMIT 10
        ) AS ct_top
    )
GROUP BY
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    co.country,
