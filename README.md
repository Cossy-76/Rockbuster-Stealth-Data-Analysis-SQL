<p>Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project</p>
<p>Overview
Welcome to the Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project repository! As a data analyst, I&#39;ve embarked on a journey to empower Rockbuster Stealth LLC&#39;s transition into the digital age. In response to the rising competition from streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime, our mission is to leverage Rockbuster&#39;s extensive movie licenses by launching an online video rental service.</p>
<p>Project Objectives</p>
<p>This repository showcases the SQL queries and scripts used to analyse Rockbuster&#39;s data, with a focus on answering crucial business questions for the 2020 company strategy. The queries delve into diverse aspects, such as identifying top-performing movies, determining average rental durations, exploring customer demographics, and assessing sales variations across different regions.</p>
<p>Technology Stack</p>
<p>Database: PostgreSQL</p>
<p>Query Language: SQL</p>
<p>Analysis Tools: Excel for technical colleagues</p>
<p>Visualization: Compelling visualizations to convey insights</p>
<p>Project Deliverables</p>
<p>Throughout the achievement, each exercise contributes to the final project. The deliverables include moderately complex SQL queries, visualizations, and a presentation summarizing the findings. These will not only answer the Rockbuster Management Board&#39;s questions but also serve as a valuable addition to your portfolio, showcasing your skills in SQL-based analysis.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Writing SQL queries for data analysis, ranging from basic CRUD operations to complex subqueries.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cleaning and summarizing data using SQL.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Performing joins, utilizing common table expressions (CTEs), and presenting results through visualizations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
