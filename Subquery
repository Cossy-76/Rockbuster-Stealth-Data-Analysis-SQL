Here is a SQL query with using subquery to determine the average amount paid by the top 5 customers.

SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid."Total Amount Paid") AS "Average Amount Paid"
FROM (
    SELECT
        c.customer_id AS "Customer ID",
        c.first_name AS "Customer First Name",
        c.last_name AS "Customer Last Name",
        co.country AS "Country",
        ct.city AS "City",
        SUM(p.amount) AS "Total Amount Paid"
    FROM
        customer AS c
    JOIN
        address AS a ON c.address_id = a.address_id
    JOIN
        city AS ct ON a.city_id = ct.city_id
    JOIN
        country AS co ON ct.country_id = co.country_id
    JOIN
        payment AS p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
    WHERE
        ct.city IN (
            SELECT ct_top.city
            FROM (
                SELECT ct.city, COUNT(c.customer_id) AS customer_count
                FROM customer AS c
                JOIN address AS a ON c.address_id = a.address_id
                JOIN city AS ct ON a.city_id = ct.city_id
                JOIN country AS co ON ct.country_id = co.country_id
                GROUP BY ct.city
                ORDER BY customer_count DESC
                LIMIT 10
            ) AS ct_top
        )
    GROUP BY
